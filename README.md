# My Resume
Hello there!

Here you will find a small project in which I decided to display all my experience and habilities, hoping to also show a bit of what I can do and how I do it.

The tools I used are Python, Django and Docker.

Thank you for being here and take a bit of interest into my humble work.

Constructive feedback is very much appreciated! :)
